#The residual standard error (0.06) can be thought of as the average error in predicting life

#checking confidence interval of model

#The results suggest that we can be 95 percent confident that the interval [0.15,0.54] contains the 
#true change in life expectancy for a 1 unit change in Diphtheria.

#checking whether our model satisfies statistical assumptions:

#Terms meaning:

#Normality -For fixed values of the independent variables, the dependent variable is normally 
#distributed.
#Independence(Autocorrelation) -The Yi values are independent of each other.
#Linearity -The dependent variable is linearly related to the independent variables.
#Homoscedasticity -The variance of the dependent variable doesn't vary with the levels of the 
#independent variables. We could call this constant variance, but saying homoscedasticity makes me
#feel smarter.

#combine 4 plots
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model2)

#Normal Q-Q plot (upper right) is a probability plot of the standardized residuals against the values 
#that would be expected under normality.Since we met the normality assumption, the points on this graph 
#fall on the straight 45-degree line.

#Since points in the Scale-Location graph (bottom left) has a random band around a horizontal line,
#homoscedasticity assumption is met.

#We can see that in graph 4, residuals vs. leverage, there are few outliers at 124,134 and 95 in 
#predictors value.

#To properly interpret the coefficients of the OLS model, we must satisfy a number of statistical 
#assumptions:
                                          
#The car package provides a number of functions that significantly enhance your ability to fit and
#evaluate regression models.
                                        
#gvlma package provides a global test for linear model assumptions.

#NORMALITY
                                      
qqPlot(model2, labels=row.names(train), id.method="identify",simulate=TRUE, main="Q-Q Plot")
            
#With the exception of points 58 and 71(these are outliers), all the points fall close to the line and are within the confidence
#envelope, suggesting that we've met the normality assumption fairly well.                          

#INDEPENDENCE OF ERRORS(AUTOCORRELATION)
durbinWatsonTest(model2)

#The nonsignificant p-value (p=0.404) suggests a lack of autocorrelation, and conversely
#an independence of errors. The lag value (1 in this case) indicates that each observation
#is being compared with the one next to it in the dataset.

#Unless we add the option simulate=FALSE, we'll get a slightly different value each time we run
#the test.

#LINEARITY of predicted values (component plus residual plots or partial residual plots)
crPlots(model2)

#Nonlinearity in any of these plots suggests that we may not have adequately modeled the functional 
#form of that predictor in the regression. If so, we may need to add curvilinear components such as
#polynomial terms, transform one or more variables (for example, use log(X) instead of X), or
#abandon linear regression in favor of some other regression variant.

#The component plus residual plots confirm that you've met the linearity assumption.
#The form of the linear model seems to be appropriate for this dataset.

#Homoscedasticity
ncvTest(model2)
spreadLevelPlot(model2)

#The ncvTest() function produces a score test of the hypothesis of constant
#error variance against the alternative that the error variance changes with the level of
#the fitted values. A significant result suggests heteroscedasticity (nonconstant error variance).

#The spreadLevelPlot() function creates a scatter plot of the absolute standardized
#residuals versus the fitted values.

#In the spread-level plot,the points form a random horizontal band around a horizontal line of best fit. 
#If we'd violated the assumption, we'd expect to see a nonhorizontal line.

#suggested power p is that would stabilize the nonconstant error variance. For example, if the plot showed 
#a nonhorizontal trend and the suggested power transformation was 0.5, then using sq root Y rather than Y in the
#regression equation might lead to a model that satisfies homoscedasticity. If the suggested power was 0, 
#we'd use a log transformation. In the current example, there's no evidence of heteroscedasticity and the
#suggested power is close to 1 (no transformation required).

library(gvlma)
gvmodel <- gvlma(model2)
summary(gvmodel)

#we can see from the printout (the Global Stat line) that the data meet all the statistical
#assumptions that go with the OLS regression model (p = 0.573)

#gvlma() function performs a global validation of linear model assumptions as well as separate evaluations
#of skewness, kurtosis, and heteroscedasticity. In other words, it provides a single omnibus (go/no go) test of
#model assumptions.

#Multicollinearity

vif(model2)

sqrt(vif(model2))>2

#Multicollinearity can be detected using a statistic called the variance inflation factor (VIF). For any
#predictor variable, the square root of the VIF indicates the degree to which the confidence interval for 
#that variable's regression parameter is expanded relative to a model with uncorrelated predictors.
# sq. root vif >2 indicates a multicollinearity problem.

# We see that multicollinearity is there in our data.
#Infant deaths, under 5 deaths, polio, thinness 1 to 19 yrs and thinness 5 to 9 yrs are highly correlated. 

#outlier test
outlierTest(model2)

#Outliers are observations that aren't predicted well by the model. They have either unusually large 
#positive or negative residuals. Positive residuals indicate that the model is underestimating the response
#value, while negative residuals indicate an overestimation.

#One way to identify outliers is points in the Q-Q plot that lie outside the confidence band are considered 
#outliers. A rough rule of thumb is that standardized residuals that are larger than 2 or less than -2 are 
#worth attention.

#The car package also provides a statistical test for outliers. The outlierTest() function reports the
#Bonferroni adjusted p-value for the largest absolute studentized residual:

#this function tests the single largest (positive or negative) residual for significance as an outlier. 
#If it isn't significant, there are no outliers in the dataset. If it is significant, we must delete
#it and rerun the test to see if others are present.

#Comparing models: one including status variable and other without including status variable

#Comparing nested models using the anova() function
anova(model2,model1)

#Because the test is nonsignificant (p = .504), we conclude that status variable don't
#add to the linear prediction and we're justified in dropping them from our model.
